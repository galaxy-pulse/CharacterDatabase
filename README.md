# characterdatabase
A database of characters that Cody and I have written either together or separately. 

This project is my attempt at getting better with SpringBoot applications and Postman. Using characters from books that my husband and I have written (either
together or separately), I will create a list that allows users to look up specific lists such as all male characters, characters of a specific class, and so 
on.
